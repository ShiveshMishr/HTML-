            <p>A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records,
                called
                blocks,
                that are securely linked together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic
                hash of
                the
                previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data
                nodes are
                represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
                created. Since
                each
                block contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form a chain (compare linked
                list
                data
                structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain
                transactions are
                irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
                retroactively
                without
                altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

                Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public
                distributed
                ledger, where
                nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
                Although
                blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be
                considered
                secure by
                design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]
            </P>
            <P>A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto
                in
                2008[6] to
                serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work
                by Stuart
                Haber,
                W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[7] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The
                implementation of
                the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem
                without
                the need
                of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and
                blockchains that
                are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a
                type of
                payment
                rail.[8]
            </P>
            <P>Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such
                privatized
                blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[9] however, others have argued that
                permissioned
                blockchains,
                if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than
                permissionless
                ones.[4][10]

                    alt="image" style="float: right; height:300; width:650;">
                Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer
                Systems
                Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a
                cryptographically secured
                chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to
                implement a system
                wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer
                incorporated Merkle
                trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be
                collected into one
                block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The
                New York Times
                every week since 1995.[14]
            </p>
            <p>
                The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi
                Nakamoto in
                2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks
                without
                requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the
                rate at which
                blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core
                component of the
                cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]
            </p>
            <p>
                In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have
                occurred on the
                network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[15] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from
                January 2016 to
                January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200
                GB by early
                2020.[16]
            </p>

            The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
            popularized as
            a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[17]
            <p>
                According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains
                attained a 13.5%
                adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[18]
                Industry trade groups
                joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
                organisations,
                and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with
                blockchain".[19] For
                the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their
                business.[20]
            </p>
            <p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[25]</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
                <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation[26] and verification)</li>
                <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
